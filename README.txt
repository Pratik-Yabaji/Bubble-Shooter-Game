Roll Number : 210070094
Basic Features :
1. Modified the motion of bubble in vertical direction, by adding an acceleration in vertically downward direction.
2. Introduced collision between the bubble and the bullet; and both bubble and bullet disappears on collision.(the color of bubble changes on collision with the shooter)
3. Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter, the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it. (In order to introduce health ( _ / 3 ), I cancelled the effect of basic feature no.3 by commenting it out in main.cpp) 
Extra Features :
1. Used different types of bubbles of different size, when the bullet hits the larger bubble of radius greater than threshold radius and changed the horizontal velocity of the bubble.
2. Introduced Timmer, Health, Score and Level. Game overs if the time overs or the Shooter_Health becomes zero.
